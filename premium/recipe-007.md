Please synthesize research on this topic from the provided content:

$ARGUMENTS

If the content above shows "$ARGUMENTS" (meaning no data was provided), please:
1. Explain that no research content was provided when they called the command
2. Inform them they can provide the information in several ways:
   - Type or paste it directly in their next message
   - Reference a file using @filename (e.g., @research.txt, @notes.pdf, @sources.docx)
   - Reference a URL using the URL directly (if the research is on a webpage)
   - Re-run the command with inline arguments: /recipe-007 <research content and sources>
3. Ask the user to provide the research materials and topic they want synthesized
4. Wait for them to share the details
5. Then proceed with the full synthesis

Otherwise, proceed immediately with the synthesis:

PLEASE PROVIDE:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1 paragraph)
   - What is the overall answer to the research question?
