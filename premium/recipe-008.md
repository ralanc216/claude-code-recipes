description: Organize scattered tasks into a prioritized, actionable system
---

Please help me organize my scattered tasks into a prioritized, actionable system.

MY RAW TASK DUMP:
"""
$ARGUMENTS
"""

If the MY RAW TASK DUMP above shows "$ARGUMENTS" (meaning no data was provided), please:
1. Explain that no data was provided when they called the command
2. Inform them they can provide the information in several ways:
   - Type or paste it directly in their next message
   - Reference a file using @filename (e.g., @data.txt, @document.xlsx, @report.pdf)
   - Reference a URL using the URL directly (if the information is on a webpage)
   - Re-run the command with inline arguments: /recipe-008 <details>
3. Ask the user to provide the necessary information
4. Wait for them to share the details
5. Then proceed with the full analysis

Otherwise, proceed immediately with creating:

PLEASE PROVIDE:

1. CLEANED TASK LIST
   - Remove duplicates and consolidate related items
   - Clarify vague items (suggest specific next actions)
   - Separate true tasks from "someday/maybe" items

2. PROJECT GROUPING
   - Group tasks by project or area of responsibility
   - Note any hidden projects (multiple related tasks)

3. PRIORITY RANKING
   Using this framework:
   - P1: Urgent AND important (do this week, can't slip)
   - P2: Important, not urgent (schedule this week)
   - P3: Urgent, less important (delegate or quick-handle)
   - P4: Neither (schedule later or drop)

4. DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS
   - Which tasks are blocked by others?
   - Any external dependencies?

5. WEEKLY PLAN RECOMMENDATION
   - Recommended focus for this week
   - What realistically fits
   - What should wait until next week

6. ITEMS NEEDING ATTENTION
   - Overdue or at-risk items
   - Items that might be delegable
   - Items that could be dropped
