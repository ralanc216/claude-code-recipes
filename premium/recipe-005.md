PLEASE PROVIDE:

1. PRESENTATION OUTLINE
   - Title slide concept
   - Section breakdown with flow logic
   - Key transition points

2. SLIDE-BY-SLIDE CONTENT
   For each slide, provide:
   - Slide title (clear and action-oriented where appropriate)
   - Main content (bullets, key points—not paragraphs)
   - Suggested visual/chart (if applicable)
   - Speaker notes (2-4 sentences of what to say)

3. FORMAT GUIDELINES
   - Maximum 4-5 bullets per slide
   - Bullets should be concise (one line each)
   - Include specific data points where relevant
   - Suggest "visual slides" where a chart/image beats text

4. CLOSING ELEMENTS
   - Clear call to action or summary slide
   - Recommended Q&A talking points
   - Anticipated tough questions with suggested responses
