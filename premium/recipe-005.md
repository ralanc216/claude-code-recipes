Please create a complete presentation for me.

TOPIC/CONTENT:
"""
$ARGUMENTS
"""

If the TOPIC/CONTENT above shows "$ARGUMENTS" (meaning no data was provided), please:
1. Explain that no data was provided when they called the command
2. Inform them they can provide the information in several ways:
   - Type or paste it directly in their next message
   - Reference a file using @filename (e.g., @data.txt, @document.xlsx, @report.pdf)
   - Reference a URL using the URL directly (if the information is on a webpage)
   - Re-run the command with inline arguments: /recipe-005 <details>
3. Ask the user to provide the necessary information
4. Wait for them to share the details
5. Then proceed with the full analysis

Otherwise, proceed immediately with creating:

PLEASE PROVIDE:

1. PRESENTATION OUTLINE
   - Title slide concept
   - Section breakdown with flow logic
   - Key transition points

2. SLIDE-BY-SLIDE CONTENT
   For each slide, provide:
   - Slide title (clear and action-oriented where appropriate)
   - Main content (bullets, key points—not paragraphs)
   - Suggested visual/chart (if applicable)
   - Speaker notes (2-4 sentences of what to say)

3. FORMAT GUIDELINES
   - Maximum 4-5 bullets per slide
   - Bullets should be concise (one line each)
   - Include specific data points where relevant
   - Suggest "visual slides" where a chart/image beats text

4. CLOSING ELEMENTS
   - Clear call to action or summary slide
   - Recommended Q&A talking points
   - Anticipated tough questions with suggested responses
