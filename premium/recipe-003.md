description: Draft professional emails and responses for complex or sensitive situations
---

Please draft an email response for me.

ORIGINAL EMAIL / CONTEXT:
"""
$ARGUMENTS
"""

If the ORIGINAL EMAIL / CONTEXT above shows "$ARGUMENTS" (meaning no data was provided), please:
1. Explain that no data was provided when they called the command
2. Inform them they can provide the information in several ways:
   - Type or paste it directly in their next message
   - Reference a file using @filename (e.g., @data.txt, @document.xlsx, @report.pdf)
   - Reference a URL using the URL directly (if the information is on a webpage)
   - Re-run the command with inline arguments: /recipe-003 <details>
3. Ask the user to provide the necessary information
4. Wait for them to share the details
5. Then proceed with the full analysis

Otherwise, proceed immediately with creating:

Please draft the email with:
- Appropriate subject line (if new email) or just the body (if reply)
- Professional but warm tone
- Clear structure and actionable content
- Appropriate length for the context

If I haven't specified the goal or key points, ask me to clarify before drafting.
