description: Generate a structured weekly status report from scattered updates
---

Please help me create my weekly status report from these raw inputs.

RAW UPDATES (from this week):
"""
$ARGUMENTS
"""

If the REPORT FORMAT above shows "$ARGUMENTS" (meaning no data was provided), please:
1. Explain that no data was provided when they called the command
2. Inform them they can provide the information in several ways:
   - Type or paste it directly in their next message
   - Reference a file using @filename (e.g., @data.txt, @document.xlsx, @report.pdf)
   - Reference a URL using the URL directly (if the information is on a webpage)
   - Re-run the command with inline arguments: /recipe-002 <details>
3. Ask the user to provide the necessary information
4. Wait for them to share the details
5. Then proceed with the full analysis

Otherwise, proceed immediately with creating:

REPORT FORMAT:
Please structure the report as follows:

1. HIGHLIGHTS (Top 3-5)
   - Most significant accomplishments this week
   - Frame as value delivered, not just tasks done
   - Include metrics or impact where available

2. PROGRESS UPDATE
   - Organized by project or workstream
   - Current status, what moved forward, % complete if relevant
   - Brief, scannable bullets

3. BLOCKERS & RISKS
   - Items that are stuck or may slip
   - Include severity (High/Medium/Low)
   - Note what's needed to unblock

4. UPCOMING (Next Week)
   - Key priorities and focus areas
   - Any important deadlines or milestones
   - Dependencies or support needed

5. NOTES / FYI (Optional)
   - Items that don't fit above but are worth mentioning
   - Early warnings or heads-up items

Keep the total report under 1 page. Use bullet points for scannability. Bold key items.
