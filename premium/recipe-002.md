RAW UPDATES (from this week):

$ARGUMENTS

REPORT FORMAT:
Please structure the report as follows:

1. HIGHLIGHTS (Top 3-5)
   - Most significant accomplishments this week
   - Frame as value delivered, not just tasks done
   - Include metrics or impact where available

2. PROGRESS UPDATE
   - Organized by project or workstream
   - Current status, what moved forward, % complete if relevant
   - Brief, scannable bullets

3. BLOCKERS & RISKS
   - Items that are stuck or may slip
   - Include severity (High/Medium/Low)
   - Note what's needed to unblock

4. UPCOMING (Next Week)
   - Key priorities and focus areas
   - Any important deadlines or milestones
   - Dependencies or support needed

5. NOTES / FYI (Optional)
   - Items that don't fit above but are worth mentioning
   - Early warnings or heads-up items

Keep the total report under 1 page. Use bullet points for scannability. Bold key items.
