## The Problem

You have a presentation coming up, but crafting a compelling speech takes forever. You know your content, but turning bullet points into a narrative that engages an audience is a different skill. Presentations fall flat because they're information dumps, not stories. You spend hours writing and rewriting, and it still doesn't flow naturally when spoken aloud. The gap between a forgettable presentation and a memorable one seems impossible to bridge.

**Pain Points:**
- Bullet points that don't become a narrative
- Content that reads well but sounds terrible spoken
- No clear structure or arc
- Missing the hook that grabs attention
- Transitions feel awkward
- Ending falls flat
- Practice reveals the script doesn't work
- Takes too long to write

---

## The Outcome

Compelling presentation scripts designed to be spoken, not read. Content with a clear narrative arc that engages audiences from opening hook to memorable close. Speaker notes that feel natural and prompt confident delivery.

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Complete speech script or detailed speaker notes
- Strong opening hook
- Clear narrative structure
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Memorable closing
- Timing estimates
- Backup shorter/longer versions

---

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- Conference keynotes and presentations
- All-hands and town hall addresses
- Sales pitches and demos
- Board presentations
- Award acceptance or tribute speeches
- TEDx-style talks
- Webinar scripts
- Training presentations

**Not a Good Fit:**
- Off-the-cuff remarks (by definition)
- Highly interactive workshops (need different format)
- Technical deep-dives with live coding
- Panel discussions (need prep, not script)

Speech Writing Request

OCCASION: Company All-Hands Meeting (Q4 Kickoff)
SPEAKER: Sarah Chen, CEO
AUDIENCE: All employees (~500 people, mix of in-person and remote)
TIME: 15 minutes

CONTEXT:
- Q3 was tough - missed revenue targets by 12%
- We did a layoff 6 weeks ago (50 people)
- Q4 is make-or-break for hitting annual goals
- New product launches next month
- Morale is shaky but people are working hard
- Holiday season approaching

KEY MESSAGES:
1. Acknowledge the difficulty of Q3 and the layoff - don't pretend it didn't happen
2. Take responsibility as leader - this isn't about blaming anyone
3. Q4 is our opportunity - we're in position to recover
4. New product is key - everyone's work comes together here
5. Culture matters more now than ever - how we treat each other through hard times
6. I believe in this team - genuine confidence, not rah-rah

STORIES/EXAMPLES TO POTENTIALLY INCLUDE:
- Specific Q3 win: Landed our biggest customer ever despite headwinds
- Product team: Shipped on schedule when everyone thought we'd have to delay
- Personal: When I've seen companies come through hard times stronger
- Team example: Customer success team's NPS increase during chaos

TONE:
- Honest and direct (don't sugarcoat)
- Warm but not soft (this is serious)
- Confident but humble (we can do this, AND I know it's hard)
- Personal - I'm talking as Sarah, not "the CEO"

SARAH'S SPEAKING STYLE:
- Conversational, not formal
- Uses rhetorical questions
- Tends to pause for emphasis
- Tells stories, not just facts
- Doesn't use corporate jargon
- Sometimes uses humor, but carefully

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Toxic positivity ("Everything's fine!")
- Blaming external factors only
- Vague platitudes
- Over-promising on Q4
- Making light of the layoff impact

VISUAL AIDS:
- Minimal slides expected (mostly Sarah speaking)
- Might show one or two charts if needed

DELIVERY FORMAT:
- Full script with speaker notes
- Mark pauses and emphasis points
- Include timing markers
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Clarify Your Core Message
**Time: 10 minutes**

Before writing, answer:
- If the audience remembers ONE thing, what should it be?
- What do you want them to FEEL?
- What do you want them to DO afterward?
- What's the narrative arc? (Where are they now → Where do they need to be)

---

### Step 2: Launch Claude Code
**Time: 30 seconds**

```bash
claude
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Speech Writing Prompt
**Time: 7-10 minutes for Claude to process**

**PRIMARY PROMPT: Speech and Presentation Script Writing**

```
Please help me write a speech/presentation.

OCCASION: [Event type]
SPEAKER: [Name and role]
AUDIENCE: [Who's listening, size, context]
TIME: [Duration in minutes]

CONTEXT:
[What's the situation? What happened recently? What does the audience already know?]

KEY MESSAGES TO CONVEY:
1. [Message 1]
2. [Message 2]
3. [Message 3]
(etc.)

STORIES/EXAMPLES AVAILABLE:
- [Story or example to potentially weave in]
- [Another story or example]

TONE:
[How should this feel? Formal/casual, serious/light, etc.]

SPEAKER'S STYLE (if known):
[How do they typically speak? Patterns, preferences]

WHAT TO AVOID:
[Anything off-limits or that would land poorly]

PLEASE CREATE:

1. FULL SCRIPT
   Complete speech script including:
   - Strong opening hook (first 60 seconds are crucial)
   - Clear narrative structure
   - Smooth transitions between sections
   - Stories/examples woven naturally into points
   - Memorable closing that calls back to opening

   Format for spoken delivery:
   - Short paragraphs (easier to deliver)
   - [PAUSE] markers where appropriate
   - [EMPHASIS] for key words/phrases
   - Timing markers [X:00] at section breaks

2. STRUCTURE OVERVIEW
   One-page outline showing:
   - Opening: [What and why]
   - Section 1: [Topic and time]
   - Section 2: [Topic and time]
   - Section 3: [Topic and time]
   - Closing: [What and why]

3. OPENING OPTIONS
   3 different ways to start:
   - Story-led opening
   - Question-led opening
   - Statement-led opening

4. CLOSING OPTIONS
   2-3 different ways to end:
   - Call-to-action close
   - Story callback close
   - Vision close

5. SPEAKER NOTES
   Key reminders for delivery:
   - Where to pause for effect
   - Which points might need emphasis
   - Audience response points (where they might react)
   - Recovery points if time runs long/short

6. CONTINGENCY VERSIONS
   - Expanded version (+3 minutes): What to add if time
   - Shortened version (-3 minutes): What to cut if needed

Write for the EAR, not the eye. This should sound natural when spoken aloud, not like a written document being read.
```

---

### Step 4: Read Aloud and Refine
**Time: 15-20 minutes**

Read the script OUT LOUD. Mark:
- Sentences that feel awkward to say
- Transitions that don't flow
- Places where you run out of breath
- Words that are hard to pronounce
- Sections that feel too long

---

### Step 5: Refine for Spoken Delivery
**Time: 15-20 minutes**

**To fix awkward phrasing:**
```
This sentence is hard to say out loud: "[sentence]". Rewrite it to be more natural when spoken—shorter words, natural rhythm, easier to deliver.
```

**To strengthen the opening:**
```
The opening needs more punch. I need to grab attention in the first 10 seconds. Make it more immediate—start with something that makes people lean in.
```

**To improve transitions:**
```
The transition between [section A] and [section B] is jarring. Create a smoother bridge that connects these ideas naturally.
```

**To make it more personal:**
```
This sounds too generic. Add more of the speaker's personal perspective and make it sound like something [Name] would actually say.
```

**To add emphasis guidance:**
```
Mark where the speaker should slow down, pause for effect, or emphasize key words. This should feel like coaching notes for delivery.
```

---

### Step 6: Create Final Package
**Time: 10 minutes**

```
Create the final speech package:

1. FINAL SCRIPT
   - Clean version for speaker review
   - All delivery notes included
   - Timing markers throughout

2. ONE-PAGE CHEAT SHEET
   - Key messages in bullet form
   - Opening and closing lines verbatim
   - Story triggers (first line of each story)
   - Transition phrases
   For speakers who prefer notes over script

3. SLIDE GUIDANCE (if applicable)
   - When to advance slides
   - What should be on each slide (minimal text)

4. REHEARSAL CHECKLIST
   - [ ] Read through once silently
   - [ ] Read aloud, standing
   - [ ] Time the full delivery
   - [ ] Mark problem spots
   - [ ] Practice opening 3x
   - [ ] Practice closing 3x

5. DAY-OF REMINDERS
   - Technical setup needs
   - Arrival time
   - Last-minute mindset tips
```

> **[0:00] OPENING**
>
> I'm not going to start by telling you everything is fine. It's not. [PAUSE]
>
> Q3 was hard. We missed our targets. Six weeks ago, fifty of our colleagues left this company—people who helped build what we have. That's not something we gloss over. That's something we sit with.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> So before I talk about Q4, before I talk about what's ahead—I want to say something clearly: I'm sorry. [PAUSE] Not in a corporate "regret any inconvenience" way. I mean, I'm genuinely sorry that we're in this position. And as your CEO, the decisions that led here are mine to own.
>
> [PAUSE—let this land]
>
> But I didn't ask you all here to apologize. I asked you here because we have work to do. And I believe—genuinely believe—that the next three months can change the trajectory of this company.
>
> Let me tell you why.
>
> ---
>
> **[1:30] SECTION 1: What We Learned from Q3**
>
> Here's what I've learned from hard times—and this isn't my first one.
>
> Difficult quarters reveal who you are. And Q3 revealed something important about us.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> In the same quarter where we missed revenue targets, we landed our largest customer ever. [PAUSE for reaction] Think about that. In our hardest quarter, we convinced the biggest company to ever bet on us that we were worth betting on.
>
> That wasn't luck. That was this team.
>
> Our product team—in the middle of uncertainty about their jobs—shipped the new platform on schedule. Not a week late. Not with compromises. On schedule. I still don't know how they did it. [SLIGHT SMILE] Actually, I do. They did it because they didn't want to let each other down.
>
> And our customer success team? NPS went UP during Q3. [EMPHASIS] Our customers love us more now than they did before things got hard. That's not supposed to happen.
>
> So yes—we missed our number. And that matters. But we didn't fall apart. We got stronger in the ways that actually count.
>
> ---
>
> **[4:30] SECTION 2: Why Q4 Is Different**
>
> Now let me tell you why Q4 isn't just about recovery. It's about breakthrough.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> Three weeks from now, we launch the product this entire company has been building toward. Everything we've done for the past two years comes together in November.
>
> I've seen the customer feedback from the beta. I've read the notes. Do you know what word keeps appearing? "Finally." [PAUSE] "Finally, someone built this." "Finally, I don't have to use three different tools."
>
> That's what we're about to release to the world.
>
> Now, I'm not going to stand here and promise we'll hit every target. The market is what it is. But here's what I know: we have the right product, at the right time, with the right team.
>
> The companies that win in hard markets are the ones that keep building while everyone else hunkers down. [PAUSE] That's what we've been doing. And now it's time to show everyone what we built.
>
> ---
>
> **[8:30] SECTION 3: What I'm Asking of You**
>
> Here's what I need from you. And I'm going to be specific, because vague asks help no one.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> First—focus. [EMPHASIS] The next 90 days, we're all doing fewer things better. If you're working on something that doesn't directly contribute to the launch or to a customer, I want you to ask your manager: "Should I be doing this?" And managers, if the answer is no, take it off their plate.
>
> Second—communication. Overcommunicate with each other. When you're remote and stressed, it's easy to assume the worst about what's happening in other teams. Don't assume. Ask. Share. Stay connected.
>
> Third—take care of yourself. I mean this. [PAUSE] I know the temptation in hard times is to work yourself into the ground. I'm asking you not to do that. We need you sharp, not exhausted. Take your weekends. See your families. This is a sprint, but it's a sprint you need to be healthy enough to finish.
>
> And fourth—look out for each other. [PAUSE—important] The people sitting next to you, on this call, in this room—they're going through the same thing you are. Check in. Offer help. That's how we get through this. Together.
>
> ---
>
> **[12:00] SECTION 4: Why I Believe in Us**
>
> I've been asked by our board, by investors, by my own family—"Are you worried?"
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> Here's my honest answer: I'm worried about the market. I'm worried about timing. I'm worried about things I can't control.
>
> But I'm not worried about this team. [EMPHASIS]
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> I've been doing this long enough to know the difference between companies that survive hard times and companies that don't. The difference isn't strategy—everyone thinks they have a strategy. The difference isn't even product.
>
> The difference is whether people actually care. [PAUSE] About the mission. About the customers. About each other.
>
> I see that here. Every day. In the late night Slacks, in the way people jump in to help, in the NPS scores that go up when they should go down.
>
> That's not something you can fake. And it's not something you can buy. It's something you build, over time, by making hard decisions the right way.
>
> That's who we are. And that's why I believe in us.
>
> ---
>
> **[14:00] CLOSING**
>
> [PAUSE—reset energy, confident]
>
> I started by saying things aren't fine. And they're not—yet.
>
> But here's what I want you to remember when you leave this room, when you go back to your desks, when Q4 gets hard—because it will get hard:
>
> We've already proven we can perform under pressure. [PAUSE]
> We're about to launch something the market has been waiting for. [PAUSE]
> And we're doing it together.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> That's the plan. That's the bet. And I'm making it on you.
>
> [PAUSE—hold eye contact with room]
>
> Let's go have a Q4 that makes everything we've been through worth it.
>
> Thank you.
>
> **[15:00]**
>
> ---
>
> **SPEAKER NOTES**
>
> **Key delivery reminders:**
> - Opening apology should be genuine—pause after "I'm sorry" and make eye contact
> - "That was this team" line—sweep eyes across room, acknowledge them
> - Product launch section—let excitement show (this is the turn in the speech)
> - "Four asks" section—count on fingers physically, makes it memorable
> - "I'm not worried about this team"—this is the emotional peak, pause before and after
> - Closing "Let's go"—end on energy, not trailing off
>
> **If running long:** Cut the "I've been asked by our board" anecdote in Section 4
>
> **If running short:** Expand on the specific customer success examples in Section 1
>
> **Potential audience reactions:**
> - Light applause after the "largest customer ever" line—pause, acknowledge, continue
> - The apology might create silence—that's okay, don't rush to fill it
> - "Let's go" ending should get energy—if it doesn't, smile and thank them anyway

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Sounds like reading, not speaking | Written for eye, not ear | Ask: "Rewrite for spoken delivery—shorter sentences, conversational rhythm" |
| Opening doesn't hook | Weak start | Ask: "Start with something that makes them lean in—a question, a surprise, a bold statement" |
| Transitions clunky | Logical but not verbal | Ask: "Create bridges that sound natural spoken: 'Speaking of...' 'Here's the thing...' 'Now...'" |
| Too long | Over-explaining | Ask: "Cut 20%. What can we remove without losing the core message?" |
| Doesn't sound like speaker | Generic voice | Ask: "Make this sound like [Name]—more [casual/direct/warm/etc.]" |
| Closing falls flat | No callback or action | Ask: "End with a callback to opening, clear action, or memorable line they'll remember" |

---

## Tips from Experience

1. **The first 60 seconds matter most.** Audiences decide whether to pay attention in the opening. Make it count.

2. **Write for the ear, then test with your mouth.** Read everything aloud. What looks fine often sounds terrible.

3. **One message per section.** Audiences can't track five points. Give them one big idea to hold onto.

4. **Stories beat statistics.** A story about one customer is more memorable than data about 1,000.

5. **Silence is a tool.** Pauses aren't awkward—they're emphasis. Script them in.

6. **End on energy.** However you end—call to action, story, vision—end with energy, not trailing off.

## How This Pattern Applies Elsewhere

This recipe's core pattern—**clarify message → structure narrative arc → write for spoken delivery → refine through reading aloud**—applies broadly:

| Role | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Executives** | All-hands, board presentations |
| **Sales** | Pitches, demos, proposals |
| **Marketing** | Webinars, conference talks |
| **Trainers** | Course delivery, workshops |
| **HR** | Policy announcements, culture talks |
| **Anyone** | Any time you need to speak |

---

## Next Steps

2. **Gather your material:** Key points, stories, examples
3. **Generate the script:** Use this recipe
4. **Read aloud and refine:** Test with your mouth, not just eyes
5. **Rehearse fully:** Practice the complete speech at least 3 times
6. **Deliver confidently:** Trust the preparation
