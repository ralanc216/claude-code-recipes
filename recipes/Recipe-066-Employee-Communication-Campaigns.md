# Employee Communication Campaigns

**Recipe #66: Craft Internal Communications That Actually Get Read**

---

| Setup Time | Time Saved | Difficulty | Best For |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 5 minutes (first time) / 2 minutes (repeat) | 3-5 hours per campaign | Beginner | HR, Internal Comms, Leadership, People Operations |

---

## The Problem

Important messages disappear into inbox black holes. Employees complain they weren't told, but the email was sent. Announcements get misunderstood, spawning rumor mills. Leaders communicate, but the message doesn't land. Change initiatives fail because communication was an afterthought. Everyone knows internal comms matter, but nobody has time to do it well—so it's thrown together at the last minute.

**Pain Points:**
- Important announcements ignored
- Messages misunderstood or misinterpreted
- No consistent communication approach
- Leaders speak, employees don't hear
- Changes surprise people who "should have known"
- Communication fragmented across channels
- No way to measure if messages landed

---

## The Outcome

Well-planned communication campaigns with clear messaging, appropriate channels, and measured impact. Communications that employees actually read, understand, and act on. A systematic approach that makes important messages land.

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Communication strategy and timeline
- Key messages and talking points
- Multi-channel content (email, Slack, meeting scripts)
- FAQ document
- Manager cascade guide
- Measurement approach

---

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- Organizational changes
- Policy updates
- Benefit changes
- New initiatives launch
- Crisis communications
- Cultural programs
- Major announcements
- Change management

**Not a Good Fit:**
- Routine operational updates
- Single-channel one-off messages
- External communications (different approach)
- Crisis requiring immediate response (too slow)

---

>
> **Supporting Messages:**

> ## All-Hands Script
>
> **[CEO Script - January 6 All-Hands]**
>
> ---
>
> **Opening (2 minutes):**
>
> "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here. I have an important announcement to share today, and I want to be direct with you about a change we're making and why.
>
> First, I want to acknowledge that what I'm about to share will affect each of you differently, and I know some of you won't like it. I ask that you hear me out on the reasoning, and then we'll take your questions."
>
> ---
>
> **Main Announcement (8 minutes):**
>
> "Starting March 1, CloudSync is moving to hybrid work.
>
> Here's what that means specifically: We're asking everyone to be in our San Francisco office three days a week—Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Monday and Friday are flexible for remote work.
>
> **Why we're doing this:**
>
> We've been fully remote for nearly five years. In many ways, it's worked well. You've been productive, we've grown, and we've built a great company. I'm proud of what we've accomplished.
>
> But I've also seen the limits of remote work. The spontaneous collaboration, the quick whiteboard sessions, the relationships built over lunch—those things have suffered. Our new people don't know our veterans. Our teams work in silos. The creative friction that drives great products has diminished.
>
> I believe CloudSync's next chapter requires us to be together more. Not all the time—I'm not asking you to give up flexibility entirely. But enough time that we can build the company I know we're capable of building.
>
> **What this means for you:**
>
> For those of you in or near San Francisco—this will be an adjustment, but manageable. You'll need to plan your weeks, figure out childcare or commutes, and adapt your routines.
>
> For those of you who moved away during remote work, or who were hired as remote—this is harder. I know that. Some of you may need to relocate. Some of you may have constraints that make this very difficult.
>
> **Here's what we're offering:**
>
> - A 60-day transition period. The policy is effective March 1, but we'll work with you if you need time to adjust.
> - Relocation support of $2,500 for employees within 60 miles who need to move closer.
> - An exception process for genuine hardship cases. I won't promise exceptions are easy to get—they're meant for real constraints, not preferences. But the process exists.
> - For those hired with explicit remote agreements, we'll honor those through June 2025 to give you time.
>
> **I want to be honest:**
>
> This decision won't make everyone happy. Some of you may decide this isn't for you, and if so, I respect that choice. I hope you'll stay—I believe we're building something special—but I understand if this changes things for you.
>
> What I'm not going to do is pretend this is easy or that everyone will love it. It's a real change with real impact, and I own that."
>
> ---
>
> **Q&A Transition (2 minutes):**
>
> "I know you have questions. [HR Leader] and I will take them now. Some things we're still finalizing—like specific exception criteria—and we'll be transparent about what's decided and what's still in progress.
>
> Please use the Q&A feature in Zoom or raise your hand. We'll get to as many as we can, and anything we don't answer today will be addressed in Friday's follow-up Q&A session."
>
> ---
>
> **Closing (2 minutes):**
>
> "Thank you for hearing me out. I know this is a lot to process.
>
> Your managers will be reaching out this week to have individual and team conversations. The FAQ will be published next week. And my door is open—figuratively for now, literally starting in March.
>
> I believe in this team. I believe in CloudSync. And I believe that what we build together—actually together—will be extraordinary.

> ## Manager Cascade Kit
>
> **Manager Talking Points:**
>
> When talking with your team:
>
> 1. **Acknowledge the impact:** "I know this is a big change, and I want to hear how you're feeling about it."
>
> 2. **Explain you're available:** "I'm here to talk through what this means for you specifically."
>
> 3. **Be honest about what you know:** "Here's what I know about the exception process... Here's what's still being finalized..."
>
> 4. **Don't make promises you can't keep:** "I can't guarantee an exception, but I can help you understand the process."
>
> 5. **Point to resources:** "The FAQ will be published January 15. The Q&A session is January 8."
>
> **How to Handle Difficult Questions:**
>
> | Question | Response Guidance |
> |----------|------------------|
> | "What if I can't relocate?" | "There's an exception process for hardship. I can help you understand if your situation qualifies." |
> | "Why is leadership doing this?" | "The honest answer is they believe in-person collaboration will help us grow. I understand you may not agree." |
> | "Can I go part-time?" | "That's not something decided in this policy. Talk to HR about your specific situation." |
> | "What if I quit?" | "I hope you won't, but I understand this may change your calculus. Take time to decide." |
>
> **What NOT to Say:**
>
> - Don't speculate on exceptions ("I'm sure they'll approve yours")
> - Don't criticize the decision publicly
> - Don't promise things you can't deliver
> - Don't minimize the impact ("It's not that bad")
>
> **Escalation:**
> If you can't answer a question: "That's a great question. Let me find out and get back to you by [date]."
>
> ---
>
> ## FAQ Document
>
> **General:**
>
> **Q: When does this take effect?**
> A: March 1, 2025.
>
> **Q: Which days are required in office?**
> A: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Monday and Friday are flexible for remote work.
>
> **Q: Can I choose different in-office days?**
> A: No. We chose Tue/Wed/Thu specifically to ensure team overlap. This isn't negotiable.
>
> **Q: Why is this happening?**
> A: We believe in-person collaboration will accelerate our growth. After four years of remote work, leadership feels it's time to rebuild the connection that comes from being together.
>
> **Relocation & Support:**
>
> **Q: I moved away during COVID. What do I do?**
> A: You have several options: relocate to within commuting distance, apply for an exception if you have genuine hardship, or if you were hired with an explicit remote agreement, that will be honored through June 2025.
>
> **Q: What's the relocation support?**
> A: $2,500 for employees within 60 miles of SF who need to move closer.
>
> **Exceptions:**
>
> **Q: How do I apply for an exception?**
> A: The exception process opens January 15. Submit your request through [system]. Exceptions are for genuine hardship, not preference.
>
> **Q: What counts as hardship?**
> A: Medical conditions, caregiving responsibilities, and similar genuine constraints. We're finalizing specific criteria and will publish them January 15.
>
> **Q: Will exceptions be approved?**
> A: Some will, some won't. We're being honest that this is a high bar. Please don't assume you'll get an exception.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Message too corporate | Over-sanitized language | Rewrite: "Speak like a person, not a press release. What would you say in a 1:1?" |
| Backlash higher than expected | Underestimated impact | Add: Follow-up communication acknowledging feedback, without backtracking on decision |
| Managers unprepared | Insufficient cascade kit | Expand: Add more FAQs, role-plays, and escalation paths |
| Rumors spreading | Communication gaps | Fill: Proactively address what you're hearing; don't leave vacuums |
| Low engagement | Wrong channels | Adapt: Use channels where employees actually pay attention |

---

## Tips from Experience

1. **Tell managers first.** They'll be the ones answering questions. Don't surprise them.

2. **Acknowledge the negative.** Pretending change is easy insults people's intelligence.

3. **One message, many channels.** Repeat the same key message across all channels.

4. **Be available.** Q&A sessions, office hours, manager availability—make asking questions easy.

5. **Monitor and adapt.** Listen to what people are saying and address it proactively.

6. **Follow through.** If you promise an FAQ by January 15, deliver it January 15.

4. **Measurement framework**
5. **Lessons learned archive**

**Sample Setup:**
```

## How This Pattern Applies Elsewhere

This recipe's core pattern—**plan message → cascade through channels → equip managers → measure impact**—applies broadly:

| Role | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **HR/Comms** | All employee communications |
| **Leadership** | Vision and strategy communication |
| **Change Management** | Transformation programs |
| **Marketing** | Internal marketing |
| **Product** | Internal product launches |
| **IT** | System change communications |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Clarify the message:** What exactly are you communicating?
2. **Understand the audience:** Who needs to know and how will they react?
3. **Plan the campaign:** Use this recipe
4. **Validate:** Get stakeholder approval
5. **Execute:** Follow the timeline
6. **Measure and adapt:** Track impact, adjust as needed
