# Process Documentation and SOPs

**Recipe #42: From Tribal Knowledge to Reliable Operations**

---

| Setup Time | Time Saved | Difficulty | Best For |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 10 minutes (first time) / 5 minutes (repeat) | 4-8 hours per process | Beginner | Operations, All Departments, Trainers |

---

## The Problem

Critical processes live in people's heads, not in documentation. When that person is sick, on vacation, or leaves the company, the knowledge goes with them. Even when processes are documented, the documentation is often outdated, incomplete, or so confusing that people don't follow it. The result is inconsistent execution, errors, lengthy onboarding, and operational fragility.

**Pain Points:**
- Tribal knowledge dependencies
- Inconsistent process execution
- Long onboarding times for new staff
- Errors when regular person is unavailable
- Outdated or incomplete documentation
- "Just ask Sarah" as the operating procedure
- Quality varies by who's doing the work

---

## The Outcome

Clear, complete, and maintainable standard operating procedures that enable anyone with appropriate training to execute the process correctly. Documentation that actually gets used because it's practical and accurate.

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Complete SOP with step-by-step instructions
- Decision points clearly mapped
- Exception handling documented
- Visual process flow
- Quality checkpoints
- Training-ready materials
- Maintenance plan for updates

---

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- Recurring operational processes
- Cross-training documentation
- Quality-critical procedures
- Compliance-required processes
- New hire onboarding materials
- Knowledge capture from departing employees

**Not a Good Fit:**
- One-time projects (not recurring)
- Creative work without standard steps
- Executive decision-making (not proceduralizable)
- Processes still being designed

SOP Documentation Request

PROCESS NAME: Monthly Revenue Recognition Close

PROCESS OVERVIEW:
Every month-end, we need to recognize revenue from contracts according to ASC 606.
This involves reviewing new contracts, calculating recognition schedules, posting
entries, and reconciling to the subledger.

PURPOSE:
- Accurate GAAP revenue recognition
- Clean financial close
- Audit-ready documentation

TRIGGER: First business day after month-end

FREQUENCY: Monthly

OWNER: Revenue Accounting Manager

ROUGH STEPS (as I know them):
1. Pull list of all new contracts signed during the month from Salesforce
2. Review each contract for revenue recognition treatment
3. Check if contract has performance obligations we need to separate
4. Calculate revenue schedules in Excel
5. Upload schedules to NetSuite
6. Run recognition for the month
7. Review output and post entries
8. Reconcile revenue subledger to GL
9. Document any issues or adjustments
10. Get manager sign-off

SYSTEMS USED:
- Salesforce (contract data)
- Excel (calculations)
- NetSuite (ERP/GL)
- SharePoint (documentation)

DECISION POINTS:
- Whether to recognize ratably or at point in time
- Whether there are multiple performance obligations
- How to handle contract modifications
- What to do with unusual terms

COMMON EXCEPTIONS:
- Contracts with non-standard terms
- Multi-year deals with variable consideration
- Contract modifications mid-stream
- Credits and refunds

WHO WILL USE THIS:
- Revenue accountants (daily executors)
- New hires during training
- Auditors during review
- Backup personnel when primary is out

CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH THE PROCESS:
- Too much variation in how different people do it
- New people take months to get up to speed
- Auditors always have questions about documentation
- When the main person is out, things get missed
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Capture Process Knowledge
**Time: 15-30 minutes**

Get the information:
- Interview the SME or document from your own experience
- Capture the rough flow first
- Note decision points and exceptions
- Identify tools and systems
- Understand quality requirements

---

### Step 2: Launch Claude Code
**Time: 30 seconds**

```bash
claude
```

Step [X] needs more detail. A new person wouldn't know how to [specific action]. Break this down into sub-steps and include what to look for.
```

**To improve decision points:**
```
The decision at step [X] isn't clear. Add specific criteria for each path. When exactly do you choose option A vs. option B?
```

**To add exception handling:**
```
What happens if [scenario]? This isn't covered. Add exception handling for this situation.
```

**To improve usability:**
```
This is very detailed but hard to reference quickly. Create a one-page quick reference version with just the essential steps for experienced users.
```

>
> ---
>
> ## 4. Detailed Procedure
>
> ### Step 1: Generate New Contracts Report
> **System:** Salesforce
> **Time:** 15 minutes
>
> 1.1. Log into Salesforce
>
> 1.2. Navigate to **Reports > Revenue Accounting > New Contracts**
>
> 1.3. Set date range:
>    - Start Date: First day of month
>    - End Date: Last day of month
>
> 1.4. Click **Run Report**
>
> 1.5. Export to Excel:
>    - Click **Export**
>    - Select **Excel Format**
>    - Save as: `NewContracts_[YYYY-MM].xlsx`
>
> [SCREENSHOT: Salesforce report screen with date filters]
>
> **Quality Checkpoint:** Verify row count matches "New Contracts" dashboard tile
>
> **Expected Outcome:** Excel file with all new contracts for the month
>
> **Potential Issues:**
> | Issue | Solution |
> |-------|----------|
> | Report times out | Reduce date range, run in batches |
> | Missing contracts | Check with Sales Ops for late entries |
>
> ---
>
> ### Step 2: Review Contracts for Recognition Treatment
> **System:** Excel, Contract Documents
> **Time:** 30-60 minutes depending on volume
>
> For each contract in the export:
>
> 2.1. Open the contract document (linked in Salesforce)
>
> 2.2. Identify **performance obligations**:
>    - What distinct goods/services are promised?
>    - Can they be separated?
>
>    **Decision Point: Single vs. Multiple Performance Obligations**
>    - If ONE performance obligation → Continue to Step 2.3
>    - If MULTIPLE → Go to Step 2.2a (Allocation Sub-process)
>
> 2.3. Determine **recognition timing**:
>
>    | Contract Type | Recognition Method |
>    |--------------|-------------------|
>    | Subscription/SaaS | Ratably over term |
>    | Professional Services (time-based) | As delivered |
>    | Professional Services (milestone) | At milestone completion |
>    | Perpetual License | At delivery |
>    | Support/Maintenance | Ratably over term |
>
> 2.4. Document in tracking spreadsheet:
>    - Contract ID
>    - Recognition method
>    - Start/end dates
>    - Monthly recognition amount
>    - Notes on any unusual terms
>
> [SCREENSHOT: Recognition tracking spreadsheet template]
>
> **Quality Checkpoint:** All contracts have documented recognition method
>
> ---
>
> ### Step 2.2a: Multiple Performance Obligation Allocation
> **When to use:** Contract has more than one distinct deliverable
>
> 2.2a.1. List each performance obligation
>
> 2.2a.2. Determine **standalone selling price (SSP)** for each:
>    - Use actual price if sold separately
>    - Use similar transaction pricing
>    - Use cost-plus margin if needed
>
> 2.2a.3. Allocate total contract value based on relative SSP:
>    ```
>    Obligation Amount = Total Contract × (Obligation SSP / Total SSP)
>    ```
>
> 2.2a.4. Apply recognition method to each allocated amount
>
> 2.2a.5. Document allocation and rationale
>
> **Exception:** If unsure about allocation, escalate to Revenue Accounting Manager before proceeding
>
> ---
>
> ### Step 3: Calculate Recognition Schedules
> **System:** Excel (Revenue Schedule Template)
> **Time:** 30-45 minutes
>
> 3.1. Open `Revenue_Schedule_Template.xlsx`
>
> 3.2. For each contract, enter:
>    - Contract ID
>    - Customer name
>    - Total contract value
>    - Recognition method
>    - Start date
>    - End date
>
> 3.3. Verify formula calculations:
>    - Monthly amounts should equal total contract value when summed
>    - Recognition should not begin before contract start date
>
> 3.4. Save file as: `Revenue_Schedules_[YYYY-MM].xlsx`
>
> **Quality Checkpoint:**
> - Sum of all schedules = Total new contract value (±$1 for rounding)
> - No recognition before contract execution date
>
> ---
>
> ### Step 4: Upload to NetSuite
> **System:** NetSuite
> **Time:** 15-20 minutes
>
> 4.1. Log into NetSuite
>
> 4.2. Navigate to **Transactions > Revenue > Revenue Schedule Upload**
>
> 4.3. Click **Choose File** and select your schedule file
>
> 4.4. Click **Validate**:
>    - Review any errors
>    - Correct in source file if needed
>    - Re-upload until validation passes
>
> 4.5. Click **Upload**
>
> 4.6. Note the upload batch ID: ____________
>
> [SCREENSHOT: NetSuite upload screen with validation results]
>
> **Potential Issues:**
> | Issue | Solution |
> |-------|----------|
> | Customer not found | Add customer in NetSuite first |
> | Date format error | Ensure dates are MM/DD/YYYY |
> | Duplicate schedule | Check if contract already loaded |
>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Steps too vague | Insufficient detail | Ask: "A new person wouldn't know how to do [X]. Add specific instructions" |
| Too much detail | Over-documentation | Ask: "Focus on what's essential. What can be assumed vs. must be stated?" |
| Decision points unclear | Missing criteria | Ask: "Add specific criteria for when to choose each option" |
| Exceptions not covered | Limited experience | Ask: "What happens if [edge case]? Add exception handling" |
| Hard to follow | Poor organization | Ask: "Reorganize with clearer numbering and visual structure" |
| Doesn't match reality | Documented ideal, not actual | Ask: "Adjust to reflect how this actually works, including workarounds" |

---

## Tips from Experience

1. **Document the actual process, not the ideal.** If there are workarounds, document them (and maybe fix them later).

2. **Be specific about systems.** "Enter the data" is useless. "Click the blue 'Submit' button in the lower right" is helpful.

3. **Include decision criteria.** "Use judgment" isn't a procedure. "If order value exceeds $50,000, escalate to manager" is.

4. **Test with someone new.** Have someone unfamiliar with the process try to follow your SOP. Where they get stuck is where you need more detail.

5. **Build in quality checkpoints.** Tell users how to verify they're on track before continuing.

6. **Plan for maintenance.** SOPs rot quickly if not updated. Assign ownership and review schedules.

---

1. **Create SOP template** for consistency
2. **Establish naming convention** for documents
3. **Set up central repository** accessible to users
4. **Define review cycle** (quarterly, annually)
5. **Track usage and feedback** for improvements

**Sample Setup:**
```

## How This Pattern Applies Elsewhere

This recipe's core pattern—**capture process knowledge → structure in actionable steps → include decisions and exceptions → make executable by others**—applies broadly:

| Role | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Operations** | All operational processes |
| **Finance** | Financial close, reporting, controls |
| **HR** | Hiring, onboarding, offboarding |
| **IT** | System administration, incident response |
| **Sales** | Lead handling, quoting, contracting |
| **Customer Success** | Onboarding, support, renewals |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Identify critical processes:** What's most important or most problematic?
2. **Capture knowledge:** Interview SMEs or document your own expertise
3. **Generate SOP:** Use this recipe for structured documentation
4. **Test with users:** Have someone follow the SOP
5. **Refine based on feedback:** Fix gaps and unclear areas
6. **Implement and maintain:** Deploy and keep updated
