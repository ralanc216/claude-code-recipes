# Data Quality Assessment

**Recipe #59: Find and Fix the Data Problems Before They Find You**

---

| Setup Time | Time Saved | Difficulty | Best For |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 5 minutes (first time) / 2 minutes (repeat) | 2-4 hours per assessment | Intermediate | Analysts, Data Teams, Operations, Finance |

---

## The Problem

Bad data leads to bad decisions. Missing values corrupt reports. Duplicate records inflate metrics. Inconsistent formats break automations. Data quality problems are discovered at the worst times—during board presentations, customer calls, or audit reviews. By then, credibility is damaged and fixing the data is urgent and expensive. What's needed is proactive assessment to find problems before they cause harm.

**Pain Points:**
- Data quality issues discovered during critical moments
- No systematic way to assess data health
- Duplicate records inflating counts and revenue
- Missing data causing incorrect calculations
- Inconsistent formats breaking reports
- No documentation of known data issues
- Finger-pointing when problems surface

---

## The Outcome

A structured data quality assessment that identifies issues before they cause problems. Documentation of data health across dimensions: completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, and uniqueness. Prioritized remediation plan based on business impact. Confidence in data reliability.

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Data quality scorecard
- Issue inventory with severity ratings
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation roadmap
- Monitoring recommendations
- Business impact assessment
- Stakeholder communication

---

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- Before major reporting cycles
- During system migrations
- After data integration projects
- Quarterly data health reviews
- Pre-audit preparation
- When trust in data is low
- Before automation implementation

**Not a Good Fit:**
- Real-time data monitoring (need different tools)
- Deep statistical analysis (need specialized expertise)
- Data governance policy creation (different scope)
- Small, simple datasets

## Example Output

Below is an abbreviated data quality assessment example:

---

> **DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT**
>
> **Customer Master Table | November 2024**
>
> ---
>
> ## Executive Summary
>
> **Overall Data Quality Score: 68/100** (Poor - Requires Urgent Attention)
>
> The Customer Master has significant quality issues across multiple dimensions. Revenue reporting is at risk due to duplicates, marketing campaigns are ineffective due to invalid emails, and operational processes are impaired by inconsistent formatting.
>
> **Most Critical Issue:** 1,234 duplicate customer records are inflating revenue by an estimated $340K and causing double-counting across all downstream reports.
>
> **Business Risk Level:** HIGH
>
> **Recommended Priority Actions:**
> 1. Deduplicate customer records (Week 1)
> 2. Validate and cleanse email addresses (Week 2)
> 3. Standardize state/country values (Week 3)
> 4. Implement data quality rules to prevent recurrence (Month 1)
>
> **Timeline Urgency:** Critical fixes needed before month-end close.

>
> ---
>
> ## Root Cause Analysis
>
> ### Issue: Duplicate Customers
>
> - **Symptom:** 1,234 customer records with duplicate company names
> - **Root Cause:** No duplicate detection at point of entry in Salesforce. Multiple sales reps creating records for same company.
> - **Contributing Factors:** Lack of global view, incentive structure rewards new accounts, no merge process
> - **Prevention:** Implement duplicate detection rules in Salesforce, require verification before new account creation
>
> ### Issue: Invalid Emails
>
> - **Symptom:** 2,400 bounced emails, 1,245 malformed addresses
> - **Root Cause:** Bulk import from acquired company without validation. Manual entry without format checking.
> - **Contributing Factors:** No email verification service, pressure to import quickly
> - **Prevention:** Email validation at entry, periodic verification sweep, bounce handling automation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Can't quantify impact | Missing business context | Ask: "How is this data used? What decisions depend on it?" |
| Too many issues | No prioritization | Ask: "Rank by business impact. What would cause the most harm if wrong?" |
| Root causes unclear | Surface-level analysis | Ask: "For each issue, keep asking 'why' until you reach the system or process cause" |
| Recommendations too generic | Not actionable | Ask: "Specify exact actions, owners, and effort for each remediation step" |
| Stakeholders don't care | Impact not communicated | Ask: "Translate data quality scores into business language: revenue, risk, cost" |

---

## Tips from Experience

1. **Lead with business impact.** "68/100 quality score" means nothing; "$340K over-reported revenue" gets attention.

2. **Fix the source, not just the symptom.** Cleaning data without fixing the entry process means cleaning forever.

3. **Quick wins build momentum.** Start with easy fixes that show visible improvement.

4. **Make quality measurable.** If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.

5. **Prevention beats remediation.** One validation rule saves hours of cleanup.

6. **Document the baseline.** You need to show improvement, which requires knowing where you started.

---

## Measuring Success

**You've succeeded with this recipe when:**
- [ ] Quality score improves to target level
- [ ] Critical issues are remediated
- [ ] Data-related incidents decrease
- [ ] User confidence in data increases
- [ ] Quality monitoring is operational
- [ ] Prevention rules are in place

**Track over time:**
- Overall data quality score
- Issue count by severity
- Remediation completion rate
- Time between issue and fix
- User-reported data problems
- Business metrics affected by data quality

---

## Variations

### Pre-Migration Assessment
Before system migrations:
```
Assess source data quality before migration:
- What will break in the new system?
- What needs transformation?
- What should be excluded?
- What cleanup is required pre-migration?
- What validation rules should be applied?

Focus on: Blocking issues, transformation requirements
```

### Financial Data Quality
For finance-critical data:
```
Assess with financial controls focus:
- Reconciliation accuracy
- Audit trail completeness
- Control point validation
- Segregation of duties compliance
- Historical accuracy

Include: SOX compliance considerations, materiality thresholds
```

### Customer Data Quality
For CRM and customer data:
```
Assess customer data with emphasis on:
- Contact reachability (email, phone validity)
- Duplicate customers and contacts
- Segmentation accuracy
- Consent and preference data
- GDPR/privacy compliance

Focus on: Communication effectiveness, privacy compliance
```

### Product/Inventory Data
For operational data:
```
Assess product/inventory data:
- SKU accuracy
- Pricing consistency
- Stock level accuracy
- Attribute completeness
- Category consistency

Focus on: Operational impact, customer-facing accuracy
```

---

## Building Your Repeatable System

After initial assessment, establish:

1. **Regular assessment cadence** (monthly or quarterly)
2. **Consistent scoring methodology**
3. **Automated monitoring** for critical metrics
4. **Issue tracking** from discovery to resolution
5. **Trend reporting** to show improvement

**Sample Setup:**
```

## How This Pattern Applies Elsewhere

This recipe's core pattern—**profile data → assess dimensions → quantify impact → prioritize remediation**—applies broadly:
