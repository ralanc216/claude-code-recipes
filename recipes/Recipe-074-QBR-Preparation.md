| Setup Time | Time Saved | Difficulty | Best For |

## The Problem

Quarterly Business Reviews are critical customer touchpoints that showcase value delivered, align on future goals, and identify expansion opportunities. But QBR preparation is time-consuming—gathering data, analyzing trends, creating presentations, and preparing talking points often takes 3-4 hours per account.

**Pain Points:**
- Data scattered across multiple systems (CRM, usage platform, support)
- Manually creating presentation decks takes 2-3 hours per QBR
- Generic presentations that don't resonate with specific customers
- Struggle to tell compelling value story from raw metrics
- Large portfolios mean rushed preparation and lower quality
- Miss expansion opportunities because not prepared to discuss them
- Inconsistent QBR quality across different CSMs

## The Outcome

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Comprehensive QBR presentation package with polished slides
- Value delivered summary aligned to customer's original goals
- Health metrics and engagement analysis with trends
- Roadmap alignment section connecting features to customer needs
- Expansion opportunities identified with business case
- Discussion guide with talk tracks for each section
- Professional materials that strengthen relationships and drive retention/growth
- Consistent QBR quality across your portfolio

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- Scheduled quarterly business reviews with strategic accounts
- Annual business review preparation for key customers
- Executive check-in meetings requiring polished materials
- Renewal discussions where demonstrating value is critical
- Strategic account planning sessions
- Customer advocacy discussions to build references
- Mid-contract value demonstrations to strengthen relationships
- Any formal customer review meeting with exec attendance

**Not a Good Fit:**
- Informal monthly check-ins (overkill for casual touchpoints)
- Very small accounts where formal QBR doesn't make sense
- When customer has explicitly said they don't want formal reviews
- First 90 days of relationship (use onboarding check-ins instead)

## Before You Start: Quick Checklist

- [ ] Goals established at contract start or last QBR
- [ ] ROI metrics or value realized documentation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Customer hasn't achieved goals | Can't tell positive value story, goals missed | Find other wins (adoption, efficiency, satisfaction); acknowledge gaps proactively; focus conversation on path forward not excuses |
| Low executive engagement | Executives don't attend or engage in QBRs | Ask champion to personally invite them; lead with insights that matter to executives (ROI, strategy); consider separate 15-min executive briefing |
| Customer is frustrated/unhappy | QBR might become complaint session | Acknowledge concerns upfront in opening; come with solutions not just data; consider pre-meeting to address issues before formal QBR |
| Rushing preparation | Portfolio too large, not enough prep time | Tier accounts (top accounts get full prep, others get template approach); automate data gathering; use this recipe consistently to build efficiency |

## Tips from Experience

1. **Prepare thoroughly, don't wing it** - Poor preparation shows immediately and damages credibility. Even with 50 accounts, tier them and give your top 10 the full treatment. Customers notice the difference.

2. **Lead with value, not product updates** - Start with what THEY'VE achieved using your product, not what YOU'VE released. Frame everything through the lens of their success and goals.

3. **Be honest about gaps and missed goals** - Customers respect transparency far more than spin. If a goal wasn't met, acknowledge it directly, explain why, and focus on the path forward.

4. **Listen more than you present** - Use QBR as opportunity to learn, not just report out. Best insights come from customer sharing their changing priorities and challenges.

5. **Follow up within 24 hours** - Send recap email with discussion points, commitments, and action items immediately while momentum is fresh. Delayed follow-up kills trust and accountability.

## Measuring Success

**Process Completion:**
- [ ] QBR presentation created with all key sections
- [ ] Value story connects to customer's original goals
- [ ] Discussion guide prepared with talk tracks
- [ ] Expansion opportunities identified and positioned
- [ ] Pre-meeting sent to confirm attendance and agenda
- [ ] Follow-up recap sent within 24 hours of meeting

**Tracking Metrics:**
- QBR attendance rates, especially executive presence (target: >80% exec attendance for strategic accounts)
- Customer satisfaction with QBRs measured via post-QBR survey (target: >4.5/5)
- Expansion opportunities identified per QBR (track conversion rate)
- Commitments fulfilled from QBRs tracked in next review (target: >90% completion)
- Renewal correlation with QBR quality (compare renewal rates for accounts with strong QBRs vs. weak)
- NPS changes following QBRs (positive movement indicator)

## Variations

### Variation 1: Executive Business Review (EBR)
**Prompt:** "Create annual strategic review deck for C-level audience. Focus on business outcomes (not product features), strategy alignment, partnership vision for next year, and executive-level ROI. Include industry benchmarking and competitive landscape context."

### Variation 2: Renewal-Focused QBR
**Prompt:** "Build QBR specifically designed for renewal discussion in 90 days. Emphasize value delivered over entire contract term, comprehensive ROI summary with TCO analysis, renewal package options, and address any known concerns proactively."

### Variation 3: Light-Touch QBR
**Prompt:** "Create abbreviated QBR format for mid-tier accounts: 30 minutes, 6 essential slides only (value summary, health snapshot, support, roadmap highlight, priorities, next steps). Maintain quality while reducing prep time to 45 minutes."

## Building Your Repeatable System

**1. Templates to Create:**
- Presentation deck template with standard slides that can be quickly customized
- Data gathering checklist specifying exactly what metrics to pull for every QBR
- Discussion guide template with reusable structure and question frameworks
- Follow-up email template with consistent recap format

**2. Process Integration:**
- Schedule QBRs 6-8 weeks in advance with calendar holds to all stakeholders
- Send calendar holds with agenda 2 weeks before meeting
- Set automated reminder 1 week before to start data gathering
- Create post-QBR workflow: recap email template, CRM update checklist, action item tracking

**3. Data Automation:**
- Build saved reports in analytics platform for standard QBR metrics
- Create health score trend exports for easy copy/paste
- Set up support ticket summaries that auto-generate quarterly
- Template slide deck pre-filled with customer name, logo, and static content

**4. Knowledge Repository Structure:**

## How This Pattern Applies Elsewhere

| Role/Function | Application | Example Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| Sales | Annual account reviews | Review year's performance with strategic customers, identify expansion opportunities, strengthen executive relationships |
| Consulting | Project milestone reviews | Present project progress against objectives, demonstrate value delivered, align on next phase priorities |
| Internal Teams | Department business reviews | Update leadership on quarterly progress, metrics achieved, resource needs, strategic priorities for next quarter |
| Vendor Management | Supplier performance reviews | Review vendor performance against SLAs, discuss issues, align on continuous improvement opportunities |

## Next Steps

1. **Review deck with your manager** - For high-stakes accounts, get manager feedback on positioning and messaging before customer meeting

2. **Practice key talking points** - Rehearse value story and how you'll address the mobile adoption gap proactively

3. **Confirm attendees 48 hours before** - Send reminder email confirming who's attending, share agenda, ask if anything should be added

4. **Block post-meeting time** - Reserve 30 minutes immediately after QBR for notes and recap email while fresh
