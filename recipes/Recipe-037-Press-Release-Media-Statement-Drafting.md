**Recipe #37: From News to Newsworthy Communications**

| Setup Time | Time Saved | Difficulty | Best For |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 10 minutes (first time) / 5 minutes (repeat) | 2-4 hours per release | Intermediate | PR Teams, Communications, Marketing |

---

## The Problem

Press releases follow rigid formats but need to be compelling. Every announcement feels urgent, but crafting newsworthy copy takes time. You struggle with the inverted pyramid structure, finding the right quotes, and making corporate news sound interesting. Media statements require even faster turnaround with higher stakes. By the time you've perfected the release, the news cycle has moved on.

**Pain Points:**
- Balancing format requirements with compelling copy
- Making corporate news sound newsworthy
- Finding the right angles and hooks
- Crafting authentic-sounding executive quotes
- Meeting tight deadlines for reactive statements
- Inconsistent quality across releases
- Journalist complaints about "not news"

---

## The Outcome

Professionally formatted press releases that follow AP style and journalistic conventions while being genuinely newsworthy. Media statements crafted quickly for time-sensitive situations. Content that journalists actually want to cover.

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Properly formatted press release
- Compelling headline and subhead
- Strong lead paragraph with 5 Ws
- Quotable executive statements
- Boilerplate and media contact
- Social media promotion copy
- Pitch email for journalists

---

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- Product launches and announcements
- Company milestones and achievements
- Executive appointments
- Partnership announcements
- Funding announcements
- Awards and recognition
- Event announcements
- Reactive media statements

**Not a Good Fit:**
- Crisis communications (need specialized approach)
- Regulatory filings (legal requirements)
- Highly technical announcements (need SME input)
- Breaking negative news (need PR counsel)

PLEASE CREATE:

1. PRESS RELEASE (Full Format)

   Follow standard press release format:

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (or EMBARGOED UNTIL [date/time])

   Contact:
   [PR contact name]
   [Email]
   [Phone]

   HEADLINE
   [Compelling, newsworthy headline - under 80 characters]

   SUBHEAD
   [Supporting detail - one line]

   CITY, STATE (DATE) — [Strong lead paragraph answering Who, What, When, Where, Why in first 1-2 sentences]

   [Body paragraphs in inverted pyramid - most important to least]

   [Executive quote 1]

   [Supporting details/features]

   [Executive quote 2 or customer quote]

   [Availability/pricing/next steps]

   [Boilerplate: "About [Company]"]

   ###

   - News-focused

   - Quote-led
   - Trend-driven

3. LEAD PARAGRAPH VARIATIONS
   3 different approaches to the opening

   Short email to pitch this to journalists:
   - Subject line options
   - Brief pitch (3-4 sentences)
   - Key points
   - Interview availability

6. SOCIAL MEDIA PACKAGE
   - Twitter/X announcement (280 chars)
   - LinkedIn post (150 words)
   - Key hashtags

```

---

### Step 4: Review for Newsworthiness
**Time: 10-15 minutes**

Ask yourself:
- Would I read this if I were a journalist?
- Is the lead actually news?
- Are the quotes quotable (not corporate fluff)?
- Is the format correct?
- Does it answer the key questions immediately?

---

### Step 5: Refine and Strengthen
**Time: 15-20 minutes**

**To strengthen the lead:**
```
The lead buries the news. Rewrite to put the most newsworthy element first. Lead with [specific element], not the company name.
```

**To improve quotes:**
```
These quotes sound like marketing copy. Rewrite them to be:
- Actually quotable by journalists
- Something a real person would say
- Adding information, not just cheerleading
- Including specific details or insights
```

**To find better angles:**
```
What are other angles for this story beyond "company launches product"? Consider:
- Trend angle: What larger trend does this fit into?
- Impact angle: Who benefits and how specifically?
- Timing angle: Why now? What's changed?
- Conflict angle: What problem does this solve? What was wrong before?
```

**To tighten the copy:**
```
This is too long and promotional. Cut it by 30% and remove any sentences that are purely marketing. Every paragraph should contain news.
```

---

### Step 6: Create Final Package
**Time: 10 minutes**

```
Create the final press release package:

1. FINAL PRESS RELEASE
   - Formatted and ready for distribution
   - All quotes finalized
   - Contact information complete

2. MEDIA LIST NOTES
   - Which angle for which publication
   - Customization suggestions for key targets

3. FAQ DOCUMENT
   - Anticipated journalist questions
   - Approved answers

4. EXECUTIVE BRIEFING
   - Key messages for interviews
   - What to emphasize/avoid

5. TIMELINE
   - When to send to different tiers
   - Follow-up schedule
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Sounds promotional, not news | Marketing language | Ask: "Rewrite as news, not an ad. What would a journalist actually find interesting?" |
| Weak lead paragraph | News buried | Ask: "Put the most newsworthy fact in the first sentence. Start with impact, not company" |
| Quotes sound fake | Corporate speak | Ask: "Rewrite quotes as something a person would actually say. Include specific details" |
| Too long | Over-explaining | Ask: "Cut to 400 words. Every paragraph must contain news" |
| No clear angle | Generic announcement | Ask: "What's the trend story? Why should anyone care about this beyond customers?" |
| Wrong format | Template issues | Specify: "Follow AP style exactly. Standard press release format" |

---

## Tips from Experience

1. **Lead with news, not your company.** "Acme Software announced..." is weak. Lead with what's actually newsworthy.

2. **Quotes should add, not repeat.** If the quote just restates what's in the release, it's useless.

3. **Numbers are your friend.** Specific data (40% reduction, $15/month) makes releases more credible and quotable.

4. **Think like a journalist.** Would you cover this? What would make you cover it?

5. **Have multiple angles ready.** Different publications want different stories. Customize your pitch.

6. **Keep it short.** Most press releases are too long. If you can't say it in 400-500 words, rethink what you're saying.
