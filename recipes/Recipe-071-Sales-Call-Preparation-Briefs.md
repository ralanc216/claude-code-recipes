---

| Setup Time | Time Saved | Difficulty | Best For |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 20 minutes (first time) / 10 minutes (repeat) | 30-60 minutes per call | Intermediate | Sales Reps, Account Executives, Account Managers |

## The Problem

Sales professionals spend significant time preparing for important calls—researching accounts, reviewing history, understanding stakeholder dynamics, anticipating objections, and planning their approach. This prep work is critical for successful outcomes but eats into selling time. Worse, when rushed, reps go into calls under-prepared, missing opportunities or stumbling on basic questions. The information needed often exists across CRM, email, news sources, and tribal knowledge, but synthesizing it quickly is challenging.

**Pain Points:**
- Gathering scattered account information from CRM, email threads, and conversation notes
- Understanding complex stakeholder relationships and decision-making dynamics
- Identifying relevant competitive intelligence and how to position against it
- Crafting tailored talking points that resonate with specific personas
- Anticipating objections and preparing effective responses on short notice
- Balancing thorough preparation with the reality of limited time between calls
- Remembering key details and maintaining consistency across team-selling situations

---

## The Outcome

A comprehensive pre-call brief that provides account context, stakeholder profiles, meeting objectives, talking points, anticipated objections with responses, competitive positioning, and recommended next steps—enabling reps to walk into every call prepared, confident, and strategic.

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Account snapshot with key facts, current situation, and relationship status at a glance
- Stakeholder profiles identifying priorities, concerns, and communication styles for each attendee
- Meeting game plan with recommended flow and key messages
- Tailored talking points with proof points and discovery questions
- Objection handling responses for anticipated pushback
- Competitive positioning guidance specific to this account's evaluation

---

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- Important prospect calls or product demonstrations requiring preparation
- Executive-level meetings where first impressions are critical
- Quarterly business review preparation for key accounts
- Renewal or expansion discussions with existing customers
- Competitive displacement opportunities where positioning matters
- Reactivation calls to dormant accounts requiring context refresh
- Cross-sell or upsell conversations needing account understanding
- Any high-stakes customer interaction with business impact

**Not a Good Fit:**
- Routine check-ins with well-known contacts (over-preparation)
- Cold outreach calls where account information is minimal
- Quick transactional calls where relationship doesn't matter
- Time-sensitive calls where there's literally no prep time available

**PRIMARY PROMPT: Pre-Call Preparation Brief**

```
Claude, I have an important sales call coming up. Help me create a comprehensive pre-call prep brief.

Account: [Account name and basic details]
Meeting type: [Discovery / Demo / Negotiation / Executive presentation / Renewal discussion]
Date/Time: [When this is happening]
Duration: [How long the meeting is scheduled for]
Format: [In-person / Video / Phone]

ACCOUNT CONTEXT:
[Paste account information from CRM: company size, industry, current status, contract value, timeline]

PAST INTERACTIONS:
[Paste interaction history: previous meetings, key discussions, what was covered, outcomes]

UPCOMING MEETING DETAILS:
Confirmed attendees:
[List attendees with titles and any context about each]

Meeting objectives:
[What you're trying to accomplish in this call]

Known concerns or questions:
[Any issues, objections, or questions you're aware of]

COMPETITIVE SITUATION:
[Who else they're evaluating, what you know about competitive activity]

OUR SOLUTION FIT:
[How your product/service addresses their specific needs]

Please create a comprehensive pre-call brief with:

1. ACCOUNT SNAPSHOT
   - Key facts at a glance
   - Current situation summary
   - What's at stake in this meeting

2. STAKEHOLDER PROFILES
   - For each attendee: Role, priorities, likely concerns, how to engage them
   - Power dynamics and decision-making influence
   - Who to address for what topics

3. MEETING GAME PLAN
   - Recommended agenda flow
   - Key messages to land
   - Timing allocation

4. TALKING POINTS
   - Opening (first 2 minutes)
   - Core value proposition tailored to this account
   - Proof points and references to use
   - Discovery questions still needed

5. OBJECTION HANDLING
   - Anticipated objections from each stakeholder
   - Recommended responses
   - Pivot strategies

6. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
   - How to differentiate without bashing
   - Strengths to emphasize
   - Topics to avoid

7. NEXT STEPS STRATEGY
   - Ideal outcome from this meeting
   - Fallback positions
   - Specific asks to make

Format this for quick scanning—I need to be able to review in 10-15 minutes before the call.
```

---

### Step 4: Review and Validate
**Time: 5-10 minutes**

**Check immediately:**
- Account snapshot accurately reflects current situation
- Stakeholder profiles match what you know about attendees
- Meeting game plan aligns with confirmed duration and format
- Key messages address their known pain points

**Spot-check specifics:**
- Do talking points feel natural, not scripted?
- Are objection responses addressing real concerns you've heard?
- Does competitive positioning feel appropriate (not too aggressive)?
- Is the recommended next step realistic for this stage?

---

### Step 5: Refine and Iterate
**Time: 5-10 minutes**

**Create quick-reference cheat sheet:**
```
Claude, now create a one-page "cheat sheet" I can have in front of me during the call with:
- Key names with pronunciation notes if needed
- Top 3 talking points
- Critical proof points/numbers
- Objection one-liners
- Questions to ask
- Specific ask/close language
```

**Add stakeholder detail:**
```
Claude, I just learned that [stakeholder name] has [specific concern or background]. Can you update their profile and adjust the talking points to address this?
```

**Adjust competitive positioning:**
```
Claude, they just mentioned they're also talking to [Competitor X]. Can you add specific competitive positioning for that competitor to the brief?
```

**Update with breaking news:**
```
Claude, the company just announced [recent news]. How should I incorporate this into my opening and value proposition?
```

---

### Step 6: Export Final Output
**Time: 2 minutes**

```
Claude, please provide:
1. The full pre-call brief in markdown format that I can save
2. The one-page cheat sheet formatted for printing

Make sure both are ready to use right before my call.
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Limited account information | Don't have much CRM history or context | Focus on what you can research (company website, news, LinkedIn); prepare more discovery questions; be upfront about wanting to understand their situation better |
| Unknown attendees added late | New stakeholders added you don't know | Quick LinkedIn research; prepare flexible talking points; ask champion for intel; have discovery questions ready for new personas |
| Competitive intel incomplete | Don't know who else they're evaluating | Prepare general differentiation points; include question about evaluation criteria; focus on your strengths rather than competitor weaknesses |
| Meeting objectives unclear | Not sure what customer expects | Contact champion or organizer to clarify; prepare flexible agenda; start meeting by aligning on objectives |
| Brief too long to review | Created comprehensive brief but no time | Use the quick-reference cheat sheet instead; focus on stakeholder profiles and key objections; scan talking points only |
| Information changed last minute | Deal status or attendees changed | Quick update prompt to Claude with changes; prioritize updating stakeholder section and talking points; adjust expectations |

---

## Tips from Experience

1. **Update the brief closer to the meeting.** Things change; refresh with latest information within 24 hours of the call for maximum relevance.

2. **Share with your team if team-selling.** Ensure everyone has the brief and knows their role. Avoid speaking over each other or contradicting.

3. **Review the cheat sheet right before the call.** Last 5-10 minutes before the call, scan the quick reference to activate your memory.

4. **Note what actually happened after.** Document how the call went, what worked, what you missed. Improves future briefs.

5. **Build on past successes.** Save winning briefs as templates for similar accounts. Pattern match to save time.

6. **Include pronunciation notes.** If stakeholder names are unfamiliar, include phonetic pronunciation to avoid embarrassment.

7. **Time your review properly.** Complex briefs need 15-20 minutes to internalize; schedule dedicated review time.

8. **Focus on the people, not just the pitch.** The best briefs help you connect with humans and have strategic conversations.

## Measuring Success

**You've succeeded with this recipe when:**
- [ ] You walk into calls feeling prepared and confident, not scrambling
- [ ] You're able to reference account context naturally without obvious note-checking
- [ ] Objections don't catch you off guard; you have responses ready
- [ ] Stakeholders feel heard and understood (they say "you get our situation")
- [ ] You advance the deal to clear next steps more consistently

**Track over time:**
- Win rate on briefed calls vs. non-briefed calls
- Average deal size on well-prepared opportunities
- Time from first meeting to close
- Rep confidence scores (self-reported before calls)

---

## Variations

### Variation 1: Discovery Call Brief
Lighter brief focused on research questions, initial qualification criteria, and first-meeting rapport building.

```
Claude, create a discovery call brief for this prospect. Focus on qualification questions, pain point discovery, and rapport building rather than solution positioning. I need to understand if there's a fit first.
```

### Variation 2: Technical Demo Brief
Emphasis on technical attendees, demo flow customization, technical proof points, and anticipated technical objections.

```
Claude, this is a technical demo for engineering stakeholders. Focus the brief on technical proof points, integration questions, and security/architecture objections. Include demo flow recommendations.
```

### Variation 3: Negotiation Prep Brief
Focus on deal terms, negotiation leverage points, concession strategy, and walk-away criteria.

```
Claude, we're entering negotiation on this deal. Create a brief focusing on negotiation strategy: our leverage points, likely requests, concession options, and walk-away terms. Include BATNA analysis.
```

## Building Your Repeatable System

After using this recipe 2-3 times, establish your system:

1. **Create templates by meeting type.** Standardize brief structures for discovery, demo, exec presentation, negotiation, renewal. Customize from template rather than starting fresh each time.

2. **Build objection library.** Document common objections by persona with proven responses. Reference this library in every brief.

3. **Maintain proof point database.** Organize customer references and stats by industry/use case. Pull relevant proof points quickly.

4. **Integrate with CRM workflow.** Build brief creation into sales process (required before Stage X meetings). Store briefs with opportunity records for continuity.

**Sample Folder Structure:**
```

├── templates/
│   ├── discovery-brief-template.md
│   ├── demo-brief-template.md
│   ├── exec-presentation-template.md

## How This Pattern Applies Elsewhere

This recipe's core pattern—**synthesizing context, profiling stakeholders, and preparing talking points**—applies broadly:

| Role | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Customer Success** | Renewal preparation and QBR planning for strategic accounts |
| **Consulting** | Client presentation prep and stakeholder engagement planning |
| **Business Development** | Partnership meeting preparation with decision maker profiles |
| **Executive Engagement** | Board meeting or investor presentation preparation |
| **Recruiting** | Candidate interview prep with background research and questions |

---

## Next Steps

1. **This week:** Create your first pre-call brief for an upcoming important call. Time how long it takes and track the outcome.

2. **Track your results:** Compare win rates and next-step conversion on briefed vs. non-briefed calls over the next quarter.

3. **Iterate:** After each call, note one thing to improve in your brief process. Build a personal playbook over time.

4. **Share:** If it improves your outcomes, share the approach with your team. Build organizational capability.
