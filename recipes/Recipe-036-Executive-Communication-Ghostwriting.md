# Executive Communication Ghostwriting

**Recipe #36: From Leader's Ideas to Polished Communications**

---

| Setup Time | Time Saved | Difficulty | Best For |
|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 15 minutes (first time) / 5 minutes (repeat) | 3-6 hours per communication | Intermediate | Executive Assistants, Communications Teams, Chiefs of Staff |

---

## The Problem

Executives need to communicate constantly—emails to all-hands, messages to the board, customer letters, internal announcements—but rarely have time to craft these carefully. The gap between what leaders want to say and polished, impactful communication is where things break down. Messages come out either too rushed to be effective or take so long to perfect that the moment passes.

**Pain Points:**
- Executives dictate bullet points but need polished prose
- Voice and tone vary across communications
- Critical messages get delayed waiting for wordsmithing
- Drafts require multiple revision cycles
- Sensitive topics need careful framing
- No institutional memory of what worked before

---

## The Outcome

Professional communications that sound authentically like the executive—ready in minutes instead of hours. Messages that maintain the leader's voice while being polished, appropriate, and impactful. A system that learns the executive's style over time.

**What You'll Have When Done:**
- Draft ready for executive review
- Multiple tone/approach options
- Consistent voice matching
- Appropriate framing for audience
- Key messages clearly articulated
- Rapid turnaround on time-sensitive communications

---

## When to Use This Recipe

**Good Fit:**
- All-hands emails and announcements
- Board and investor communications
- Customer letters from the CEO
- Internal memos and updates
- Congratulatory and recognition messages
- Difficult news and change announcements
- Holiday and milestone messages

**Not a Good Fit:**
- Legal documents (need legal review)
- Financial disclosures (regulatory requirements)
- Personal correspondence
- Messages where authentic roughness is the point
- Crisis communications requiring PR involvement

**Sample Input:**
```
Executive Communication Request

EXECUTIVE: Maria Chen, CEO
COMMUNICATION TYPE: All-hands email announcement

CONTEXT:
- We're doing a reduction in force (RIF) - 50 people, ~8% of company
- Happening Friday - this email goes out Thursday evening
- Reasons: Market conditions, need to extend runway, pivot to profitability
- Affected employees get individual notifications before this email
- We want to be honest but also reassuring to remaining employees

KEY POINTS MARIA WANTS TO CONVEY:
1. This was a hard decision - I take responsibility
2. We're doing this to strengthen the company for the long term
3. We're taking care of affected employees (severance details)
4. Here's what's NOT changing - our mission, our commitment
5. Here's what IS changing - our focus areas
6. I'm confident about our future - here's why
7. What happens next - town hall Friday, manager conversations

TONE:
- Honest and direct - don't sugarcoat
- Empathetic - acknowledge the pain
- Confident but not dismissive of the difficulty
- Personal - this should sound like Maria, not a corporate statement

MARIA'S VOICE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Tends to be direct, doesn't use a lot of corporate jargon
- Uses first person - "I" not "we" for decisions she made
- Often acknowledges uncertainty honestly
- Balances hard truths with forward momentum
- Signs emails casually: "— Maria"

CONSTRAINTS:
- Can't disclose specific names before individual notifications
- Can't promise no future layoffs (we don't know)
- Need to mention severance but HR will send details separately
- Should mention the town hall on Friday

SAMPLE OF MARIA'S WRITING STYLE:
[Previous all-hands email showing her voice]

LENGTH: 400-600 words
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Gather Executive Input
**Time: 10-15 minutes**

Get the raw material:
- What are the key points?
- What's the context?
- Who's the audience?
- What's the desired outcome?
- Any constraints or sensitivities?
- Collect voice samples if available

Even rough bullet points work. The goal is capturing intent.

---

### Step 2: Launch Claude Code
**Time: 30 seconds**

```bash
claude
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Ghostwriting Prompt
**Time: 5-7 minutes for Claude to process**

---

**PRIMARY PROMPT: Executive Communication Ghostwriting**

```
Please help me ghostwrite a communication for an executive.

EXECUTIVE PROFILE:
- Name/Title: [Executive name and role]
- Communication style: [Direct, formal, warm, etc.]
- Voice characteristics: [How they typically write/speak]

COMMUNICATION DETAILS:
- Type: [Email, letter, announcement, etc.]
- Audience: [Who will receive this]
- Context: [What's happening, why this communication]
- Desired outcome: [What you want recipients to think/feel/do]

KEY POINTS TO CONVEY:
1. [Point 1]
2. [Point 2]
3. [Point 3]
(etc.)

TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- [Tone descriptors]
- [What to avoid]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [What can/can't be said]
- [Sensitivities to navigate]

VOICE SAMPLE (if available):
"""
[Paste example of executive's previous writing]
"""

TARGET LENGTH: [Word count or time to read]

PLEASE CREATE:

1. PRIMARY DRAFT
   Full communication ready for executive review:
   - Opens with appropriate hook/context
   - Delivers key messages in logical order
   - Maintains executive's authentic voice
   - Closes with appropriate call to action or sign-off
   - Uses formatting that matches their style

2. ALTERNATIVE OPENING OPTIONS
   3 different ways to start this communication:
   - More direct/urgent
   - More empathetic/personal
   - More context-setting

3. KEY MESSAGE VARIATIONS
   For the most important point, offer 2-3 different framings

4. TONE CHECK
   Note any places where the tone might be misread and suggest alternatives

5. SENSITIVITY FLAGS
   Identify any phrases that might land poorly and offer alternatives

Match the executive's voice authentically—this should sound like them, not like a generic corporate communication.
```

---

### Step 4: Review for Voice Match
**Time: 10-15 minutes**

Check the draft against the executive's actual voice:

**Voice Check:**
- Does this sound like them?
- Would they use these words?
- Is the sentence structure right?
- Is the level of formality correct?

**Content Check:**
- Are all key points covered?
- Is the framing appropriate?
- Any misinterpretations of intent?
- Anything missing?

---

### Step 5: Refine and Adjust
**Time: 10-15 minutes**

**To adjust voice:**
```
This sounds too corporate. Maria is more direct and personal. Rewrite with:
- More "I" statements instead of "we"
- Shorter sentences
- Less business jargon
- More like she's talking to people she knows
```

**To change framing:**
```
The opening is too soft. Maria would lead with the hard news directly, then explain. Restructure to put the main announcement in the first paragraph.
```

**To add specificity:**
```
Add more concrete details about what "taking care of affected employees" means:
- X weeks severance
- Benefits continuation through Y
- Job placement support
```

**To handle sensitivity:**
```
The line about "strategic realignment" sounds like corporate doublespeak. Maria would say this more directly. What's a more honest way to say we're cutting projects that aren't working?
```

---

### Step 6: Create Final Package
**Time: 5 minutes**

```
Create the final communication package:

1. FINAL DRAFT
   - Polished communication ready for executive review
   - All refinements incorporated

2. TALKING POINTS
   - 3-5 key messages if executive is asked follow-up questions
   - Anticipated questions and suggested responses

3. SUGGESTED SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS
   (if email)
   - 3 options with different tones

4. PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST
   - [ ] All key points covered
   - [ ] Voice matches executive
   - [ ] Sensitive areas handled appropriately
   - [ ] No factual errors
   - [ ] Appropriate length
   - [ ] Clear call to action (if needed)
```

---

## Example Output

Below is an abbreviated ghostwritten communication example:

---

> **SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS:**
> 1. Changes to our team - please read
> 2. A difficult but necessary decision
> 3. Important update from Maria
>
> ---
>
> **PRIMARY DRAFT:**
>
> Team,
>
> I need to share some difficult news. Tomorrow, we're reducing our team by 50 people—about 8% of the company.
>
> I'm not going to bury the lead or dress this up in corporate language. This is hard. These are talented people who've contributed to what we're building, and the decision to let them go is mine to own.
>
> **Why we're doing this**
>
> The market has shifted faster than any of us expected. Our runway, which looked comfortable a year ago, now needs to stretch further. We have a choice: keep going as we are and run out of options, or make hard cuts now to give ourselves the time and resources to reach profitability.
>
> I chose the second path. Not because it's easy—it isn't—but because I believe in what we're building and I want to make sure we're here to finish building it.
>
> **What's happening for affected teammates**
>
> Anyone impacted will hear from their manager directly before this email goes out. We're providing:
> - 12 weeks of severance
> - Benefits through the end of Q1
> - Job placement support and references
>
> HR will follow up with detailed information. If you know of opportunities for our departing teammates, please share them.
>
> **What this means for those staying**
>
> I know layoffs create uncertainty. "Am I next?" is a fair question. Here's what I can tell you honestly: I can't promise this will never happen again—I don't control the market. But I can promise that we've sized this reduction to give us real runway, and that the plan we're executing gives us a clear path to profitability.
>
> Our mission hasn't changed. Our product roadmap is largely intact. What's changing is our focus—fewer bets, deeper investment in what's working.
>
> **What happens next**
>
> Friday at 2pm, I'm hosting a town hall where I'll share more about our path forward and answer your questions directly. Your managers will also be available for one-on-ones.
>
> This is a hard day. I'm not going to pretend otherwise. But I'm confident in this team and what we're capable of building together.
>
> — Maria
>
> ---
>
> **ALTERNATIVE OPENING (More Empathetic):**
>
> "Team, I've been dreading writing this email. Tomorrow, we're reducing our team by 50 people, and no amount of business rationale makes that easier to say."
>
> **ALTERNATIVE OPENING (More Context-Setting):**
>
> "Team, over the past few months, I've been transparent about the challenges in our market. Today I need to tell you what we're doing about it—and it's not easy news."
>
> ---
>
> **TALKING POINTS FOR FOLLOW-UP:**
>
> 1. "This was about runway and reaching profitability, not performance"
> 2. "We sized this to be a one-time action, not the first of many"
> 3. "Our product strategy is intact—we're focusing, not retreating"
> 4. "I take responsibility for this decision"
>
> **SENSITIVITY FLAGS:**
>
> - "Give ourselves time and resources" - Some may read this as prioritizing company over people. The context makes it clear, but watch for this in Q&A.
> - "I can't promise" - Honest but may increase anxiety. Consider whether to soften or keep the honesty.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Doesn't sound like executive | Insufficient voice samples | Add: "Here's how [name] actually writes: [paste examples]" |
| Too formal/corporate | Default to business speak | Ask: "Make this more conversational and human—less corporate-speak" |
| Missing key nuance | Context not clear | Add: "The political context is [X]. Keep in mind [Y] when framing" |
| Too long | Over-explaining | Ask: "Cut this by 30%. [Name] is direct—every sentence should earn its place" |
| Wrong emotional tone | Tone mismatch | Ask: "The tone is too [X]. Make it more [Y] while keeping the same content" |
| Sensitive area mishandled | Insufficient guidance | Specify: "For [topic], be careful to [guidance]—this is sensitive because [reason]" |

## Tips from Experience

1. **Collect voice samples early.** The more examples of the executive's writing you have, the better the match. Save their best communications.

2. **Know their pet peeves.** Every executive has words or phrases they hate. Know these and avoid them.

3. **Understand the relationships.** Who the audience is and their relationship to the executive affects tone significantly.

4. **Less is usually more.** Executives often prefer shorter, more direct communications. When in doubt, cut.

5. **Get the opening right.** Executives often rewrite openings. Provide options so they can choose.

6. **Handle sensitive topics with extra care.** Flag anything that could be misread and offer alternatives.

## Building Your Repeatable System

After several communications, build your system:

1. **Create an executive voice profile** capturing their style
2. **Build a template library** for common communication types
3. **Maintain a "what worked" archive** of successful communications
4. **Document pet peeves and preferences**
5. **Track audience response** to different approaches

**Sample Setup:**
```

│   ├── maria-chen-ceo/
│   │   ├── voice-guide.md
│   │   ├── sample-communications/

## How This Pattern Applies Elsewhere

This recipe's core pattern—**capture intent → match voice → structure for impact → refine for sensitivity**—applies broadly:

| Role | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Executive Assistants** | All executive communications |
| **Communications Teams** | Company-wide messaging |
| **Chiefs of Staff** | Leadership communications |
| **PR/Marketing** | External executive content |
| **HR** | Sensitive employee communications |
| **Board Relations** | Director communications |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Build voice profile:** Collect samples of the executive's best communications
2. **Document preferences:** Note their style patterns and pet peeves
3. **Start with low-stakes:** Practice with routine messages first
4. **Build trust:** Show the executive the process and iterate
5. **Scale to sensitive:** Once voice match is solid, tackle harder communications
